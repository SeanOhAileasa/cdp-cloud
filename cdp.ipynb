After creating a baseline, you need to define how much variation (variance) from it should warrant an alert to the management. For example, you may decide to generate an alert if CPU utilization over a 60-minute period exceeds 90% when the expected baseline is 65% utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "You would not recommend ``Event Correlation``. Event correlation is a technique of linking events and triggers from different systems to find a common relationship. Intelligent management systems exist that can sift through a list of log and alert messages and identify the underlying cause. An event can trigger many messages, and many actions can be triggered in response. These systems can help isolate the exact event that caused the triggers. As an example, consider that a network access control list (ACL) prevents an application from accessing a database. The access denial will trigger alerts from the application, the network, and the database. An intelligent system will run through these alerts and identify the root cause.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the cloud deployment gets larger and more complex, the number of log messages can become overwhelming. This creates the need for an intelligent application to analyze the data. Event correlation supports a cloud deployment by allowing key events to be identified without manually going through thousands of log messages to isolate the source of a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating baselines of operations for your cloud deployment, you can analyze the performance of the system against known metrics over a certain period. This will help you forecast the need for adding resources to the system in the future. Any device or object in the cloud can be tracked and analyzed for utilization so that additional resources can be added automatically or manually to compensate for future requirements. This lets you find possible resource bottlenecks ahead of time and make the necessary arrangements before any operations are impacted adversely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every company needs to monitor its cloud deployment to ensure the success of its operations. To manage the operations occurring on a cloud, you need to monitor them effectively. This involves collecting data on the ongoing operations and then making appropriate decisions based on it. This process of monitoring can be completely automated, and you can define the exact metrics the system needs to look out for and report on. \n",

    "> Match each concept of cloud sizing with its correct definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``Elasticity`` – The ability to automatically stretch available computing resources as per workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``PAYG`` – The ability to pay only for what resources you use and the ability to consume more resources as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``Just in Time`` – The ability to select the exact resources based on current demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``SLA`` – A document specifying exact specifications of resources the cloud provider is bound to provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling or sizing computing resources as per requirements is a key feature of a cloud deployment. There are three key concepts that help specify sizing for the cloud:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Elasticity – This involves the automatic addition of servers or any other computing resources by the cloud when the workload increases. These resources are de-allocated when the workload lessens. The consumer need not get involved with adding or removing resources, because the cloud automatically senses when more computing resources are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- PAYG – Pay As You Go (PAYG) indicates that a cloud consumer only pays for the computing resources that are used. This means that if at any point due to an increased workload, additional servers or networking options are added, the extra costs are borne by the consumer, and after the workload lessens so does the corresponding costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- On Demand or “Just in Time” – This concept allows cloud users to select the computing resources they wish to add or remove from their cloud using a cloud management application. This way they can customize the computing power they need based on the requirements. On demand is usually a manual configuration, while elasticity occurs automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Need to be familiar with the concept of performance ``Capacity Planning``. \n",
    "\n",
    "Performance capacity planning maps the computing demands of a business to the available computing resources in the cloud. The process of capacity planning involves first knowing the performance of existing systems and the systems’ current usage patterns. This data is then used to make predictions for future computing demands so that provisioning and allocating the necessary computing resources to meet that demand can be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "For correct capacity planning, the system workload needs to be analyzed and the underlying computing resources that service that workload need to be identified. These resources can include networking infrastructure, storage servers, system memory, and microprocessors. The utilization rate of these resources will help indicate the performance ceiling of a particular resource that may be limiting the overall performance of the system. Then the resources that may be causing a bottleneck to the system during heavy workloads can be upgraded by scaling either vertically or horizontally. Vertical scaling involves getting more high performance resources while horizontal scaling requires simply acquiring more resources to accommodate the workload.\n",

    "A budgetary analysis of your cloud deployment will help you ascertain the expected expenses on your cloud over a specific time period. This involves performing forecasting and planning expenditures for specific sections of your cloud computing environment. When performing budgeting for a cloud deployment, it is critical to ensure that correct governance is implemented so that the costs of IT and its performance are in sync while also ensuring that the team responsible for managing technology is fully mobilized. A great way to implement this is to keep a cloud budgeting control tool that generates real-time alerts when and where specific budgets are overrun or when an application is expected to surpass its budget as per its current usage. These alerts can be set for specific projects and sent to the appropriate company division. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has the AWS Cost Explorer tool, which can help you forecast your cloud costs on a daily or monthly basis. It operates using machine learning algorithms that analyze your past costs to forecast the future. The AWS Budgets tool allows you to create necessary alerts by email or SMS for budget overruns."

    "\n",
    "Volume-based licensing is a model that allows software to be used on several devices. An organization can opt for volume-based licensing based on the size of the organization and its business type. A Volume License Key (VLK) ensures that an organization can only use each license on a fixed maximum number of devices. This VLK needs to be kept private by the organization, which needs to record the total number of installations done with the license. Compliance to the license agreement is also checked via a licensing audit.\n",
    "\n",
    "You would not opt for a ``Socket-based`` licensing scheme. \n",
    "\n",
    "Socket-based licensing for a cloud is a licensing system for an application that is numbered by the number of CPUs used by the application, as opposed to CPU cores for core-based licensing. A socket-based license for a software application accounts for the total number of CPU sockets that exist in a host that will use the application. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a Cloud Failover Appliance (CFA) by Infrascale, two sockets are needed for an ESX or ESXi host, which has two CPUs inside it, each with four cores. This means that if you were performing a backup using the failover software of VMs from four hosts, each with two CPUs, you would need eight sockets licensed through the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "A ``Core-based`` licensing metric or subscription is based on the total number of server cores that reside inside all of the processors across a cloud platform. This licensing model allows for greater mobility inside the cloud. A minimum number of cores need to be covered by the license for each processor and server. Also, each physical core inside a server needs to be covered by the license. Core-based licensing began in Windows Server 2016 to ensure consistent licensing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each cloud vendor offers some standard templates for subscriptions, which cover pricing and use of various cloud resources. The pricing and licensing costs can be based on users, sockets, volume, or cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "You would not use ``Per-user`` licensing in this scenario. Per-user licensing in a cloud allows for software to be used by one user per license. One license can cover a single file server, desktop, or laptop. Each license can cover two Android or iOS devices. As an example, when using Kaspersky Endpoint Security Cloud, the total number of users under a single license is calculated by the total number of devices that are being protected and half the number of protected Android and iOS mobile devices. In this instance, you will need 100 licenses to protect 100 desktops or laptops, and this will also cover 200 mobile devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "``User Density`` is not a licensing scheme. User density, also known as ``Virtual Machine (VM) Density`` when seen in a cloud, is the maximum number of VMs that are available on a single physical host, as long as all of them can be run together normally and none of them are short on resources. VM density is a metric that indicates system efficiency and contributes to the overall Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of a cloud deployment. The more the VM density, the more cost-effective and efficient the system will be. A realistic VM density estimate is up to 20 VMs per physical host, which is a high-capacity host. Although the cost effectiveness of a system rises with the number of VMs per host, large numbers of VMs have the tendency to cause complexity issues related to their management."

This is because a single tenant of the cloud may not use up the entirety of the resources at all times, so sharing among several users leads to better utilization of the resources. This also leads to reduced costs for individual users, as cloud vendors can charge a lower fee for providing multitenancy as opposed to the costs of having a dedicated infrastructure for each customer.

    "After a company’s operations have been deployed into a cloud environment, you must test it to verify that the deployment is working as expected. There are three key testing techniques that are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``Vulnerability Testing`` or ``Vulnerability Scanning`` − this involves checking the cloud deployment for any objects that may be unsecure. The scanner has a database of known exploits and checks each object in the cloud environment against these, including operating systems and applications. After the scan is complete, a report is generated on all detected security threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``Penetration Testing`` – this involves testing the accessibility of a cloud from outside the cloud to ensure that it is secure from illegal access. Penetration testing helps identify any vulnerability that may be exploited by a hacker to allow access from outside the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``Load Testing`` − this involves placing your cloud system under a load to determine its capacity for dealing with computational demands. This way you can identify exactly how your cloud deployment will behave when there is a heavy load on the system. Both average use and peak use is considered when performing load testing. Because each system is expected to fail eventually when placed under a severe load, load testing helps to pinpoint issues in the systems design and fix any bugs that may be causing performance issues.\n",

    "\n",
    "Staging is a procedure of creating a test environment that is a replica of the production environment. This is done so that application code, builds, patches, and changes can be tested thoroughly before they are deployed to the actual cloud production environment. By using a staging environment before deploying a software or software update, future performance issues can be avoided and bugs fixed before they reach an end user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two key tests that can be performed in a staging environment are Smoke Tests and User Acceptance Testing (UAT). \n",
    "\n",
    "- A ``Smoke Test`` verifies the key working functionalities of the software. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A ``UAT`` is done from the end user’s perspective to make sure the user experience and software performance is as expected. \n",
    "\n",
    "``Chaos Engineering Tests`` can also be used on a staging environment, which contains involved efforts to break the code that is meant to be deployed. This helps find any possible issues in the software before it enters a production environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud technology offers automated continuous delivery where staging is created within the cloud environment. ``Continuous Delivery`` involves incrementally building and testing code in small cycles using automation for purposes of increasing the quality of the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Performance and Regression Testing can also be performed using a staging environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``Performance Testing`` is the process of assessing the performance of a computer system when faced with a specific workload. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a performance test, the stability, response, and scalability of the system is analyzed. Performance tests help gauge the speed and reliability of the system. Some of the key indicators of performance measured in these tests include server processing times, network and web page loading times, the number of concurrent users that can successfully work on the system, and the amount of consumption of computing resources. The purpose of performance testing is to ensure that the tested system can accomplish the desired levels of service when in production. This eliminates the need to fix issues related to performance after the system has already been deployed into production, which can be an expensive task.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``Regression Testing`` is the process of testing a software application after code changes or updates have been made to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is to ensure that the application is functioning as expected. Each time the code for an application is modified, there can be issues arising from unfulfilled dependencies and other defects. The stability and sustainability of the application is ensured using regression testing after each code modification. Regression testing can be used whenever a new feature is added to an application or if the code is optimized. It is also done when patching occurs for the application or if there are configuration changes. Any software that goes through changes routinely needs constant regression testing to ensure its stability and quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three key **Regression Testing Techniques** include Complete Regression, Regression Test Selection, and Prioritization of Test Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``Complete Regression`` is the most thorough and also the most time intensive of the three, as it involves regression testing to be run on all the test suites that currently exist. This technique is used mainly when there is a major update to an application like the release of a new platform. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``Regression Test Selection`` only tests specific parts of the application that may have had changes but not the entire software, thereby reducing the overall testing time. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``Test Case Prioritization`` can also be done, which targets specific issues related to aspects of the software that a customer uses or new functionalities.\n",

    "Containers are a virtualization mechanism of cloud technology and are available in a Platform as a Service (PaaS) cloud model. They can “contain” an application program as well as all the elements the application needs to execute correctly, which may include system libraries and settings. Containers only need a host to work from, and an application in a container can be seamlessly moved from one host to another. This helps create separate user spaces on the same machine where each user space is not affected by other user spaces.\n",

    "You would not use ``Oversubscription``. \n",
    "\n",
    "Oversubscription of resources occurs when the resources offered to a customer by a cloud provider exceed the actual available computing resources in the cloud. This can occur when a cloud provider assumes that all its existing resources would never be utilized at the same time. Oversubscription can happen frequently on public clouds. The resources that can be oversubscribed include virtual CPUs, RAM nodes, and local and network storage. Several virtual CPUs can be created based on a single physical CPU with the assumption that all of them will not be used at the same time. However, by oversubscription on a public cloud, all the virtual CPUs may be used, causing deterioration in performance for individual virtual machines (VMs). Oversubscription can cause the “noisy neighbor effect,” where the performance of one VM is impacted negatively by another VM when both share the same physical host. This issue can cause an increase in a customer’s operating costs and a deterioration of overall system performance. Oversubscription can be avoided by opting for a private cloud environment, which ensures dedicated resources for the company’s computing needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You would not use ``Anti-affinity Rules``. \n",

    "- An affinity rule keeps a set of VMs on a certain host, allowing for the easy analysis of the usage of these VMs. \n",
    "\n",

    "To implement load balancing, a website’s address will be directed to a load balancer that then further distributes it among several Webservers. A huge advantage of using load balancers is that websites can be scaled by adding more servers to accommodate growing traffic. Also, redundant servers are automatically removed from use by the load balancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "A system load is the total amount of computational tasks or processes that are running on a computer system at a given instant. A cloud handles system load on its computing resources using load balancing, which distributes a workload across several systems within the cloud. With growing Internet traffic, the workload on web servers can reach overloaded states that can be avoided using cloud-based server farms for load balancing. This results in better scalability and system availability while raising reliability through greater system redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual balancing mechanism can be provided in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can use ``Software-based Load Balancers``, which are installed on computers. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alternately, you can use ``Hardware-based Load Balancers``; these are boxes with application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that are fine tuned for dedicated applications. Hardware-based solutions are faster than software-based load balancers and are used more frequently for load balancing at transport-level.\n",
    "\n",
    "``Automation Systems`` will not ensure that increased network loads will not crash the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Automation does not manage the network load on web servers. Various orchestration platforms provide an automated solution for consumers to manage the services of their cloud deployment, which allows for the rapid deployment of new cloud services and applications as needed by the cloud user(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "``Replication`` will not ensure that increased network loads will not crash the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Replication is the backing up of data across multiple data centers to ensure availability. A typical replication setup involves a main data center that has the data which is replicated in two separate backup centers, and can be Synchronous or Asynchronous:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``Synchronous Replication`` involves replicating data in real-time where the entire cloud deployment for a consumer is backed up to a remote facility. This means an entire deployment can be reset swiftly with very little loss of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``Asynchronous Replication`` involves backing up data remotely not in real-time but at certain scheduled intervals. Asynchronous replication is more cost effective than synchronous replication as it doesn’t have to be done real-time and can work even over slow networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "``VPNs`` will not ensure that increased network loads will not crash the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud providers give access to customers to the cloud via a virtual private network (VPN). VPNs provide safe and encrypted communication. A VPN in context of cloud computing allows customers to access their cloud applications remotely and securely over an un-safe public network like the Internet. A cloud consumer can monitor or manage the cloud deployment using the VPN. The VPN itself can be provided either by the cloud management center or a service provider."

    "Involves placing all of the virtual or compute machines into a special isolated subnet. Traffic in and out of this subnet is restricted with access control mechanisms. A three-tiered architecture is often used to perform Compute Segmentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tier 1: Public Internet-facing web servers are segmented so they allow only HTTP or HTTPS access.\n",

    "- Tier 3: Database servers that can be accessed only from the Tier 2 Application servers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Web hosting services use this three-tiered architecture frequently.

In this scenario, segmenting data servers helps improve I/O and security needs."

    "\n",
    "Although the shared compute environment is a feature of cloud deployments and has tremendous cost benefits as well as ease of operation, having a dedicated data center has its advantages. Three main reasons that a company may opt for a dedicated data center are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Security: Due to the need to maintain data confidentiality and security especially when dealing with sensitive data, a dedicated data center may be requested by a company from the cloud service provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Applications: The need to run certain specialist applications may result in a need to have dedicated server.\n",

    "\n",
    "The performance considerations for a cloud deployment involves setting benchmarks and then observing the trends using monitoring tools. Benchmarking helps create a standard for the system and specifies all the key metrics related to its expected operation. This helps you analyze whether the system is performing as expected or deviating from the benchmark as per the current metrics. You need to create benchmarks before you migrate servers to a cloud deployment so that the specifications of the virtual machines can be captured correctly. After creating a benchmark, you need to define how much variation (variance) from it should warrant an alert to the management.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary benefit is not ``Cost``. \n",

    "In fact, a dedicated data center for cloud will cost more than a shared data center. Cloud deployment offers some serious cost benefits to any organizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- No large capital expenses are needed for setting up hardware infrastructure (computers, networking, and storage) and maintaining it. The saved money can be invested in other areas of the organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flexible computing can be had through scaling and resiliency that adjusts to peak use removing the need for special acquisition just to support peak loads. This way extra computing resources can be added to a cloud deployment within minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extra computing resources from the cloud must be deactivated or deallocated after use to prevent unnecessary billing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary benefit is not ``Energy Savings``. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud data centers provide major energy savings by utilizing green power sources, or have reduced power utilization due to better cooling caused by proximity to cold waters. This reduces the cost of operation and increases performance for customers. Additionally, using shared computing helps better utilize physical hardware so that no computers or servers are idle and unused machines can be powered off to save energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding ``Costs and Budgets`` is a key aspect of having an effective cloud strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having budgetary control over a cloud implementation is essential to ensure that the cost of running the cloud is well within the organization’s financial constraints. Various cloud vendors, like Amazon Web Services (AWS), offer tools for planning costs and performing scalable budgeting and accurate forecasting. For example, AWS Budgets allows for email notifications to be sent when the actual running costs overrun the threshold you have set for your budget. It also allows you to configure automatic compensatory actions as a response to any budget overruns on specific accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performing a ``Business Need Analysis`` is also an important step in ensuring your cloud implementation falls within your capacity planning. \n",
    "\n",
    "A company needs to evaluate its own individual business needs as it pertains to its number of users, as cloud vendors offer their packages on a set number of users per month. Based on a company’s storage requirements, it may need to purchase its cloud storage strategically. There are two types of cloud storage, referred to as cold storage and hot storage. The less expensive cold storage is used for data that needs to be maintained mainly for compliance needs, such as archived data. Hot storage, the more expensive type of storage, is used for data that needs to be accessed far more frequently. Ensuring constant uptime for your business will need a strong networking infrastructure from the cloud provider. Similarly, strong support services offered by a cloud vendor can help ease the strain off your business and ensure high priority support for even your most high-level users. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, based on your business needs, you can consider a ``Multicloud Strategy`` for managing your organization, where different cloud vendors can be utilized for email, office applications, and productivity apps. Here, a separate cloud vendor can help manage all of these different aspects of your office system to maximize your business strategy."

Hypervisors operate between virtual machines, and actual physical hardware and can take unused memory from one virtual machine and allocate it to another virtual machine that may need it.
